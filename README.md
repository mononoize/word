# Word

## Introduction

A set of bits with a fixed size.

The Word class includes methods to manipulate (individual) bits with (bitwise) logical operations (i.e. NOT, AND, XOR,
and OR) as well as shift and rotate operations. Moreover, there are methods to convert a Word from/to other data types
(i.e. long, int, short, byte, and char).
